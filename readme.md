# Characterizing Parliament Members using LLM

## Overview

This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and characterize parliament members based on their speeches, opinions, and other textual data. The system integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, embeddings, and vector databases to generate insights and responses that mimic the perspectives of different politicians.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Extracts, cleans, and prepares parliamentary speeches.
- **Embeddings & Vector Search:** Uses Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for retrieval.
- **LLM-based Generation:** Fine-tunes responses based on retrieved data.
- **Milvus Integration:** Utilizes Milvus vector database for efficient similarity search.
- **LangChain Framework:** Implements memory and reasoning for interactive chatbot experiences.
